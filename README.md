# Servo-Pan-and-Tilt
Used to position servos' yaw and pitch with smooth movement functions
This is intended to be used with the Meccano servos which hve thier own communicatiomn method. The functions included are accelerte to velocity, which accelerates the angular velocity up to a given velocity, travels at a given velocity, and then decelearets back to rest at the given destivation angle. The other fuction is move at velocity, which moves the servo at a gven velocity to a given angle.
Currently there are two modes of use, a keypad mode were "A" is desired absoulte pitch angle, "B" is desired pitch velocity, "C" is desired absoulte yaw angle, "D" is desired yaw velocity.
The other mode uses a joystick to control panm and tilt (pitch and yaw).
